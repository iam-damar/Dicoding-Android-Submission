This is a submission in creating an android application, and I have done it well.

# Installation

```git clone https://github.com/iam-damar/Dicoding-Android-Submission.git</code>```

# Tampilan -- Display

The android interface consists of:
- Food list.
- if you click, it will go to the food details.
- And display a profile about me.

# Kode -- Code

- You can use the Android API version 26 and above, so that this android file can be extracted properly.
- Try to upgrade to Android version 4.1, for easy implementation of the code
